# My First README.md
## **Taylor Pirre**

---

*This week's material was very accessible and easy for me to grasp, as not only was the information presented in a very welcoming and succinct manner, but also because this admittedly is my second attempt at taking this course. Additionally, I have had prior experience in learning how to code from a few assignments I have had in other courses that involved designing basic code structures for interactive media. While coding for an interactive product is a bit different from web coding, many of the same basic ideas seem to overlap between the two disciplines. Though my experience with coding has thus far been on a basic level, I am very excited to begin to dive deeper into how web design and code languages function. *

*Some other principles of Web Design that interest me include:*

* *CSS and how it interacts with the HTML code.*
* *Writing interactive commands using if/else variables and possibly loops to make a webpage feel more animated and dynamic.*

This is another additional change to test things.
