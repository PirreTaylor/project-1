  <p> In that dream I'm as old as the mountains <br />
    Still as starlight reflected in fountains <br />
    <br />
    Children grown on the edge of the ocean <br />
    Kept like jewelry, kept with devotion <br />
    <br />
    You would come to me then without answers <br />
    Lick my wounds and remove my demands for now <br />
    <br />
    Eucalyptus and orange trees are blooming <br />
    In that dream there's no darkness a-looming <br />
    In that dream moving slow through the morning light <br />
  This is an extra line. </p>
